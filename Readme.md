# Computer Graphics Final Project - Space Fighter Game

As a final project for my computer graphics bachelor's degree class, I created a thrilling arcade game called Space Fighter. The objective of the game is to eliminate the invader (red) spaceship by first destroying the aliens that stand in your way.

- You can earn 10 points for each alien you defeat, and there are a total of 50 aliens, making the maximum score attainable 500.

Upon successfully eliminating the invader spaceship, players are rewarded with a special Easter egg that can be discovered by playing the game. So, come and experience the thrill of Space Fighter and uncover the hidden surprise for yourself!
